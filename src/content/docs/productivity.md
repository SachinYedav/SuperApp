# Productivity Suite 📅

Welcome to the **Productivity Suite**—your personal command center. We believe that true focus requires minimizing context switching. Instead of opening a separate app for your to-do list, another for a Pomodoro timer, and a third for background noise, SuperApp brings all your essential workflow tools into one unified, offline-capable workspace.

> **Privacy & Speed:** Your tasks, habits, and notes are instantly saved to your local storage (IndexedDB). They load instantly without waiting for network requests, ensuring your workflow remains completely uninterrupted.

## 🧭 Workspace Navigation

Just like our other Pro modules, the Productivity Suite is built for speed:
* **Desktop Users:** Seamlessly switch between the four productivity modules using the vertical sub-menu on the left.
* **Mobile Users:** Use the horizontally scrollable tabs at the top of your screen to swipe between your notes, tasks, and timers.

## 🛠️ The Core Modules

### 1. Sticky Notes (Sticky Wall)
Capture quick thoughts, reminders, or code snippets before they slip away.
* **Colorful Organization:** Your notes are displayed as vibrant, color-coded cards (Red, Blue, Green, Brown) helping you visually categorize your thoughts.
* **Auto-Dating:** Every new note automatically stamps the current date, so you always know when a thought was captured.
* **Quick Create:** Simply click the **+ New Note** button in the top right corner to instantly drop a new sticky on your wall.

### 2. Task Board
Manage your daily goals with a clean, distraction-free checklist.
* **Quick Add:** Type your goal into the "Add a new task..." input and hit **+** or press `Enter` to drop it into your list.
* **Smart Segregation:** Active tasks stay in the **TO DO** section. Once you click the circular checkmark, the task gets a stylish strikethrough and smoothly transitions into the **COMPLETED** section.
* **Stay Focused:** You can easily uncheck a completed task to move it back to your active to-do list if a goal needs revisiting.

### 3. Focus Zone (Pomodoro Timer)
Achieve deep work states and manage burnout using time-blocking. * **Interval Tracking:** Switch between three optimized modes:
  * **Focus:** Standard 25-minute deep work session.
  * **Short Break:** 5-minute breather.
  * **Long Break:** 15-minute extended recovery after multiple focus sessions.
* **Ambient Sounds:** Block out distractions. Choose from built-in background noises like **Rain, Cafe, or White Noise** directly below the timer. No need to open a separate music app!

### 4. Habit Tracker
Build consistency and transform your daily routines.
* **Streak System:** Add daily habits (e.g., "Read 10 mins" or "Drink Water"). Every time you check it off, your streak increases (shown with a 🔥 icon).
* **Gamification:** The top right corner displays your **🏆 Total Streak** across all habits, motivating you to keep the momentum going.
* **Daily Reset:** Habits uncheck themselves daily, ready for you to conquer them again.

## 🛡️ Data Safety & Deletion Logic

We know how frustrating it is to accidentally delete a long-running habit streak or an important project note. To ensure absolute data safety, SuperApp uses a **Global Confirmation Modal** for all destructive actions.

**How Deletion Works:**
1. Click the delete/trash icon on any note, task, or habit.
2. A secure overlay (Modal) will appear on your screen, pausing your workflow.
3. You must actively **check the confirmation box** acknowledging the deletion.
4. Only then will the **Confirm** button become clickable. 

*This two-step verification guarantees that your hard-earned progress is never wiped out by a misclick.*
