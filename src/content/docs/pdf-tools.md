## 💡 Pro Tip
Because PDF Master works locally, it uses your device's memory. If you are working with massive files (e.g., a 500-page textbook), closing other unnecessary browser tabs will make the processing much faster! Keep an eye on your **Local Storage** indicator on the bottom left to manage your cache.
