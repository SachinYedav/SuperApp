# Pro Video Editor 🎬 (Coming Soon)

We are building something massive. The **SuperApp Video Editor** is designed to bring desktop-grade video editing directly into your browser. No heavy software downloads, no watermarks, and no expensive subscriptions.

## ✨ What to Expect

We are combining standard video editing tools with powerful AI, ensuring everything runs smoothly within your workspace.

### 1. Multi-Track Timeline
Say goodbye to basic, single-track mobile editors. Our timeline will allow you to layer multiple video clips, audio tracks, and text graphics with a professional drag-and-drop interface. 

### 2. AI Magic Tools ✨
Editing shouldn't take hours. We are integrating smart features powered by **Gemini AI** to automate the boring parts:
* **Auto-Captions:** Generate highly accurate subtitles in seconds.
* **Background Removal:** Isolate subjects without needing a green screen.
* **Smart Cuts:** Let AI highlight and cut the best parts of your footage.

### 3. 4K Export & GIFs
Render high-quality 4K videos locally on your device. Need a quick reaction GIF? Export any timeline segment directly as an optimized GIF.

## 🔒 Privacy-First Rendering
Usually, web-based video editors require you to upload gigabytes of footage to their servers, which takes forever and compromises your privacy. 
Our Video Editor is being built on **WebAssembly (WASM)** technology. This means your videos will be processed and rendered **100% locally** on your device's hardware. Your unedited footage never touches our cloud.

*Stay tuned! We are working hard to bring this feature to your SuperApp dashboard soon.*
